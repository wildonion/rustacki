// NODEJS LIKE ASYNC METHOD ORDER OF EXECUTION
/* ------------------------------------------- */
// future objects need to live longer with 'satatic lifetime also they must be send sync so 
// we can move them between threads and scope for future solvation also they need to be pinned 
// into the ram cause they're self-ref types and pointers of self-ref types won't be updated 
// by Rust after moving to break the cycle we need to add some indirection using rc, arc, box, 
// pin, futures are placeholders with a default value which gets solved as soon as the result
// was ready then waker poll the result to update caller

                    order of async methods execution

    nodejs has its own runtime by default so there is no need to await on an async method to execute
    it because in Rust futures are lazy they do nothing unless we await on them but this is not the 
    default behaviour in nodejs we can call an async method without putting await behind it:

    async function async_operation() {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve(42);
            }, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second delay
        });
    }

    async function main() {
        let result = await async_operation();
        console.log("result", result);

        let modified_result = result * 2;
        console.log("modified_result", modified_result);
    }

    main();

    execution of async methods are not purely async we should put them in tokio::spawn
    in the following each tokio::spawn() execute each task asyncly, concurrently and independently 
    in the background without specific ordering, having any disruption in execution other codes and 
    waiting for each other to be finished executing also once the http request received from client 
    the codes get executed asyncly in the bacground, the api body is executed and the response 
    sent to the client even if those async codes are not yet executed or are being exeucted
    
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        differences between tokio::spawn() and awaiting on a joinhanlde

    tokio::spawn:
        tokio::spawn is used to spawn a new asynchronous task (future) onto the Tokio runtime without 
        blocking the current task. when you spawn a task using tokio::spawn, it returns a JoinHandle 
        that represents the spawned task. The spawned task runs concurrently with the current task 
        and can execute independently.
    
    await on a JoinHandle:
        when you await on a JoinHandle, you are waiting for the completion of the asynchronous task 
        represented by the JoinHandle. By await-ing on a JoinHandle, you are suspending the current 
        task until the spawned task completes. The result of the JoinHandle future is returned when 
        the spawned task finishes execution.

    Concurrency vs. Waiting:
        tokio::spawn allows you to run tasks concurrently, enabling parallel execution of asynchronous 
        operations. await on a JoinHandle is used to wait for the completion of a specific task before 
        proceeding with the rest of the code.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                    blocking and none blocking execution

    a future object is like a placeholder that need to be await to suspend the function execution until the result 
    gets polled by the waker, this allows other codes get executed and compiled at the same time and there would be 
    no disruption in code order execution later the placeholder gets filled with the solved value.
    none blocking generally means executing each lines of codes without waiting for the task or the codes to 
    completion which prevent other codes and parts from being executed at the same time for example, establishing 
    a TCP connection requires an exchange with a peer over the network, which can take a sizeable amount of time, 
    during this time, the thread is blocked.
    with asynchronous programming, operations that cannot complete immediately are suspended to the background. 
    The thread is not blocked, and can continue running other things. Once the operation completes, the task is 
    unsuspended and continues processing from where it left off, more specificly when you await on an asynchronous 
    operation, the function suspends its execution until the operation completes, but the function itself returns 
    a Future representing the result of the operation.
    when you await on a Future, you can assign the result to a variable or use it directly in the subsequent code,
    the result of the await expression is the resolved value of the Future appeared in form of a placeholder, which 
    you can use in later scopes, this means if you need the result of a future in other async codes or scopes you
    can use its placeholder to do the operations once the suspension gets ended the waker poll the actual value 
    and continues processing where it left off, results in updating the caller state with the solved value, meanwhile 
    other scopes and codes got executed and compiled and are waiting to fill the placeholder with the solved value,
    however thanks to the static type based langs allows other scopes know the exact type of the result of the future
    before it gets solved.
