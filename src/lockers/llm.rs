  ╰┈➤          Synchronisation Package: Arc vs Mutex/RwLock vs Atomic
    
    besides borrowing using & we got some smart and wrapper pointers allows us to share 
    the ownership of type between scopes and threads like Box, Rc, Arc (shared ownership
    without state mutation) however if we want to mutate the underlying data (shared mutable 
    state) we use &mut, RefCell, Atomic, Mutex and RwLock to make synchronisation between 
    scopes and threads safely.

    ⪼ note on pointers:
    ╰┈➤ single thread borrow: &mut | multithreaded borrow: Arc<Mutex<
        borrow requries lifetime of the type to be valid and don't gets dropped in other scopes cause 
        if the undelying type goes out of the scope the borrow gets invalidated although Rust updates 
        it with new address of the moved type but can't use after moving and dropping the type, Rust
        moves data around memory for ram optimisations by moving data they get new ownership address 
        inside the new scope this is why we shouldn't move a type if it's behind a pointer cause we 
        won't be able to use pointer after moving.

    Atomic                         ▶ single threaded/multithreaded shared reference with atomic synchronisation state mutation, supports only primitive types like atomic u32
    Rc/Arc                         ▶ single threaded/multithreaded shared reference without synchronisation and state mutation, requires Mutex or RwLock, use to build atomic type from complex types
    Rc<RefCell</Arc<Mutex</RwLock< ▶ single threaded/multithreaded shared reference with atomic synchronisation can be shared between threads safely even without using channels for state mutation and syncing
    redis redlock and zookeeper    ▶ can be used in a cluster to implement a distributed locking mechanism
    
    Arc: 
    is used for shared ownership of data across multiple threads so it's thread
    safe, it allows multiple threads to have read-only access to the same data without the 
    need for mutable access, it uses reference counting to track the number of references 
    to the shared data, it is a non-atomic operation and requires synchronization tools like
    Mutex or RwLock when modifying the reference count.
    
    Atomic:
    atomic types provide atomic operations on primitive types for shared mutable state, they
    are used for low-level synchronization and atomic operations on shared data, Atomic types 
    provide atomic read-modify-write operations on the underlying data, operations like 
    compare-and-swap, fetch-and-add, and atomic load/store are performed atomically without 
    the need for explicit synchronization.
    Atomic types ensure that operations on shared data are performed atomically without the 
    risk of data races, they are suitable for scenarios where fine-grained control over shared 
    mutable state is required they're also are typically more efficient than using locks or 
    mutexes for synchronization, especially for simple operations on primitive types.

    Key Differences:

    ╰┈➤ Ownership vs. Atomic Operations:
        Arc is used for shared ownership and reference counting, while atomic types are used for 
        atomic operations on shared mutable state.
    
    ╰┈➤ Complexity:
        Arc provides higher-level shared ownership semantics, while atomic types offer low-level 
        atomic operations on primitive types.
    
    ╰┈➤ Use Cases:
        Use Arc for shared ownership of complex data structures across threads.
        Use atomic types for fine-grained synchronization and atomic operations on primitive types.

    Atomic vs Mutex/RwLock:
    PG and Redis transactions are atomic by default (all or none) and they will be executed in a 
    multithreaded context like tokio::spawn(), the scheduler knows when to execute each transaction 
    asyncly but since they're atomic there will be no two mutator transactions executing at the 
    same time or if a transaction is being executed the second one must wait for the first one until 
    it finishes execution, it's difference with Mutex, atomics usually try attempting to do operation 
    until succeed and they're run in user mode unlike mutexes which run in kernel mode, mutexes 
    eventually end up being implemented with atomics since you need at least one atomic operation 
    to lock a Mutex, and one atomic operation to unlock a mutex, it takes at least twice long to do 
    a mutex lock. RwLock in comparison with Mutex, Mutex does not distinguish between readers or writers 
    that acquire the lock, therefore causing any tasks waiting for the lock to become available to 
    yield. An RwLock will allow any number of readers to acquire the lock as long as a writer is not 
    holding the lock.

    ╰┈➤ Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock):
        A Mutex allows only one thread to access some data at any given time.
        Every time a thread wants to access the data, it must first lock the Mutex.
        If you have a situation where you have more writes than reads, or if the 
        reads and writes are roughly equal, a Mutex is usually the better choice.
        tokio::sync::Mutex is an asynchronous Mutex that is designed to work 
        with async code within tokio.
    
    ╰┈➤ RWLock (Read-Write Lock / multiple readers or a single writer at a time):
        A RWLock allows any number of threads to read the data if there isn't a thread writing to it.
        If a thread wants to write to the data, it must wait for all the readers to finish before it 
        can obtain the lock. If you have a situation where you have many more reads than writes, a RWLock 
        can be more efficient because it allows multiple readers to access the data simultaneously.
        tokio::sync::RwLock is an asynchronous Read-Write Lock that works within the async ecosystem of tokio.
    
    ╰┈➤ When to choose tokio::sync::Mutex:
        You have frequent writes.
        The critical section (the part of the code that needs exclusive access to the data) is quick.
        You want simplicity. Using a Mutex is straightforward and avoids the complexity of dealing with 
        multiple lock types.
    
    ╰┈➤ When to choose tokio::sync::RwLock:
        You have many more reads than writes.
        You want to allow concurrent reads for efficiency.
        The critical section for reads is fast, but it’s still beneficial to have multiple readers at the same time.
        In many scenarios, a Mutex might be sufficient and can be the simpler choice, especially if write operations 
        are as common as reads or if the critical section is very short, thus not justifying the overhead of managing 
        a RWLock.

        However, if your specific case involves a lot of concurrent reads with infrequent writes and the 
        read operations are substantial enough to create a bottleneck, a RWLock might be a better choice.
